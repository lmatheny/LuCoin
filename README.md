# LuCoin


## Overview
### Description
This is a project I did for one of my honors application development courses at Purdue during my freshman year. I like to look back at it to see how far I have come in my programming journey. This app uses Java Swing for the GUI. I am very into cryptocurrency and used the final project of this class as an opportunity to design my own personal exchange. It is surface level but I believe the features were cleverly implemented. These features include buying / selling coins and fluctuating prices.
